        The person who introduced me to TrueNAS Core and inspired the idea was
        one of my college professors. He always said that as an IT guy, you
        should have your own Google Drive. Honestly, it wasn't a bad idea—not
        just for the functionality itself, but for the journey you undertake to
        build something like that. So, I bought a motherboard, 32 GB of RAM
        #ZFS, and a power supply. I chose the Corsair RM550x because, according
        to tests, it had the best efficiency in the lower power consumption
        ranges, which was exactly what I needed. And that's how my personal
        server was born. Installing this system is pretty straightforward—up
        until the point where you want the system, which takes up about 20 GB,
        not to use the entire disk. However, by editing the installation script,
        you can work around that. Currently, I use my server for backups, but it
        also serves as a station for recording footage from home cameras and for
        syncing photos from phones to NextCloud for me and my household.

        Currently, I have a Proxmox "cluster" made from two terminals. One is an
        HP t620 with 4 cores and 16GB of RAM, and the other is a Futro S920 with
        4 cores and, unfortunately, only 4GB of RAM for now. (Yes, I know that a
        cluster with only two nodes is not an ideal solution, but I'm
        considering using a Raspberry Pi as a quorum disk and also as a backup
        DNS server.) What do I use this hypervisor for? I host a few of my own
        services, primarily Tailscale for access to my home network and the
        TrueNAS server, a Cloudflare client so that household members have
        access to Home Assistant, my own DNS - AdGuard Home, Nginx Proxy
        Manager, Portainer for Docker, Home Assistant, and Trilium for
        note-taking.
